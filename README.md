# Stardeus Mod Template

This is a mod template for [Stardeus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/).

It should be the definitive example for anything moddable in this game, and will be
extended over time to contain at least one example of any moddable aspect.

See subfolders for more readme files on how to create Artwork, and Definitions.

Copy the Template folder (this folder) in Stardeus_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods\,
rename it into your mod name, change ModInfo.json, then you're ready to go.

Open this folder with Visual Studio Code, it should automatically find and link
Stardeus DLL files. Pressing F5 should compile the mod DLL file and run Stardeus.

If you are on Linux or Mac, you will need to examine what's in .vscode directory
and modify / create new scripts there accordingly to what would work on your OS.

More tutorials will follow!

Happy modding!
