# Stardeus Mod Template

This is a mod template for [Stardeus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/).

It should be the definitive example for anything moddable in this game, and will be
extended over time to contain at least one example of any moddable aspect.

See subfolders for more readme files on how to create Artwork, and Definitions.

Best place to ask questions about modding Stardeus is on [Stardeus Discord](https://discord.com/invite/89amEwP), #stardeus-modding channel.

Open this folder with Visual Studio Code, it should automatically find and link
Stardeus DLL files. Pressing F5 should compile the mod DLL file and run Stardeus.

If you are on Linux or Mac, you will need to examine what's in .vscode directory
and modify / create new scripts there accordingly to what would work on your OS.
